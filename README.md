After weeks of learning, debugging, and refining, Iâ€™ve successfully built and deployed an AI Voice Assistant that helps users improve their communication skills through real-time speech analysis! ðŸ’¬âœ¨

âœ… What it does:

Records your speech through the browser ðŸŽ¤

Transcribes your voice using Vosk

Corrects grammar with Transformer models (T5)

Analyzes sentence structure using spaCy NLP

Gives spoken feedback using Coqui TTS

All built using Flask, HTML/CSS/JS, and Python backend

ðŸ§  Whether you're practicing for interviews, improving spoken English, or just want to polish how you express yourself â€” this tool gives instant insights into your communication.

This was a solo dev project that taught me a ton about backend architecture, speech-to-text, AI model integration, and frontend-backend communication.
